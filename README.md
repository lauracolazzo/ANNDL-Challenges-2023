# Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning Coding Challenges

Welcome to the repository for Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning coding challenges! This repository contains the solution to the challenges organized within the ANNDL course at Politecnico di Milano. The coding challenges focused on utilizing neural networks and deep learning techniques to solve two tasks: image classification and time-series forecasting.

## Challenges

### Image Classification Challenge: Plant Health Detection

The Image Classification challenge in this repository revolves around classifying images of plants to determine their health status. The task involves building neural network models capable of distinguishing between healthy and unhealthy plants based on the provided images.

### Time-Series Forecasting Challenge

The Time-Series Forecasting challenge is centered around predicting future data points of time series originating from six different sources. Each source corresponds to a specific category, resulting in six distinct time series datasets.

## Repository Structure

- **ImageClassification/**
  - Contains a Python Notebook and the documentation related to the Image Classification challenge.
- **TimeSeriesForecasting/**
  - Includes a Phython Notebook and the documentation related to the Time-Series Forecasting challenge.
